# Student Study Hour Percentage Prediction

This project predicts the percentage score of a student based on the number of study hours using a simple linear regression model.
## Data
The data used for this project can be found at [http://bit.ly/w-data](http://bit.ly/w-data).

## Method
1. Load the data
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a linear regression model.
4. Evaluate the model using mean absolute error and r2 score.
5. Predict the score for 9.25 hours/day.

## Code
The main code for the prediction model is in the 'student_percentage_prediction.py' file.

## Run
1. Clone repository to local machine
2. Ensure we have necessary libraries installed ('pandas', 'scikit-learn').
3. Run the 'student_percentage_prediction.py' script.
4. The script will output the evaluation metrics and the predicted scorefor 9.25 hours/day.
